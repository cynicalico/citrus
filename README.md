a music player

## About

citrus is an opinionated music player designed to listen to music exactly how I (cynicalico) listen to music. I will be adding zero features beyond what I'll actually use. I listen to music in basically one way: whole albums front to back (or just singles, if an artist hasn't released an album/EP yet, or just has a lot of non-album singles).

I'll have playlist support too probably, but it's *really* not a priority.
